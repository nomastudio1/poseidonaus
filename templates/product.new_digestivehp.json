Every horse is different with some taking longer to respond due to repopulation of healthy microbes, particularly in their hindgut. If your horse doesn’t have obvious outward symptoms of gastrointestinal upset, positive changes are going to be less obvious but can be as subtle as improved hoof growth and increased immunity.<\/p><p><\/p><p>But remember, seeing the results is just the start. Supporting optimal digestion and the health of your horse’s gastrointestinal tract longer term with the correct diet in combination with <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> will ensure optimal health and performance into the future.<\/p>","text_cHJFYSp7xmlo8fx4":"<h3>What Evidence Do You Have That <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> Is Effective?<\/h3>","text_gNuoTksjNbXx6bh9":"<p>As part of the research and design phase of our digestive gut health supplement, we initially conducted trials with an early formulation. This formulation was tested on a variety of horses across different disciplines, yielding consistent reports of improvements in condition, topline, behavior, manure consistency, performance, appearance, and stress resilience. Since then, the formulation has only improved, further enhancing these benefits.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Additionally, a separate field study was conducted by Professor Andrew Dart (BVSc PhD, Dip ACVS, Dip ECVS) from the University of Sydney, with a cohort of randomly selected horses. The results showed a remarkable increase in feed conversion, with some horses experiencing up to ninefold increases in weekly weight gain. Prof. Dart commented, \"It is difficult to dismiss the relationship between weight gain and the addition of this supplement.\"<\/p><p><\/p><p>Ingredient selection is at the heart of what we do. In <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong>, we only use raw ingredients that have been extensively researched across multiple species, meeting the highest standards of scientific evaluation. Each ingredient is carefully chosen based on its proven functionality, with inclusion rates aligned with research to ensure their effectiveness in equine health. While we don’t conduct the original research on individual ingredients, we source only those that are backed by robust science and incorporate them into a formulation designed specifically for horses.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> is now supported by testimonials from horse owners and receives strong support, recommendations, and endorsements from veterinarians.<\/p>","text_TV3KI9CVFgh3W7vU":"<h3>Is <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> Safe For Laminitic Horses?<\/h3>","text_af1iEYEZEPSCMmd7":"<p>Yes it is.

It should be fine for foals to nibble on a bit of their mother's feed containing <strong>DigestiveRP<\/strong>. However, as there aren't studies specifically aimed at foals for a majority of the ingredients, we can't recommend giving it as part of a foal's feed. <\/p>","text_qUimGcylgK3TnXvp":"<h3>Is It Safe To Use With Other Supplements?<\/h3>","text_NQdtIIWGID47Mmfv":"<p>As <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> includes ingredients specifically designed to address gut health, it should be safe to feed alongside most other feeds and supplements. You may find that with the addition of <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> and a balanced diet with vitamins and minerals, your horse may not need additional supplements. For example, <strong>DigestiveHP<\/strong> contains a good amount of calcium, magnesium and a toxin binder, so if you are already feeding another supplement with those in it, you may find you can cut it out.
