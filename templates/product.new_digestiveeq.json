Research continues to reveal strong links between gut health and various disease conditions, anxiety, and hyperactive behaviour—factors that can impact rider safety and overall horse welfare. By providing nutrition that supports gut health, we can enhance a horse’s mental and physical well-being, improve behaviour, and support performance<\/p>","text_TutRtfc9EGRDe4bb":"<h3>How are DigestiveEQ and Stress Paste different?<\/h3>","text_CyJR63zVQnZQ5tYZ":"<p>Whilst you may see similar benefits with these products, their intended usage is what makes DigestiveEQ and Stress Paste fundamentally different. <\/p><p><\/p><p>DigestiveEQ is the daily gut-health supplement that supports your horse through their day-to-day stressors, to keep them healthy, happy and performing at their best. <\/p><p><\/p><p>The powdered form makes it ideal to mix with feed in one or two meals per day.  <\/p><p><\/p><p>Stress Paste plays best in instances of acute stress, designed to deliver immediate gut and nervous system support in the face of high impact events including competition, travel and extreme weather. Stress Paste is also recommended when first starting DigestiveEQ to provide that extra buffer support at the very beginning <\/p><p><\/p><p>Conveniently formulated in a concentrated paste, Stress Paste is easy to give ahead of, during and after known or predicted stressful events.<\/p>","text_QoJctWMAuF3P4z9V":"<h3>How Soon Will I See A Result From Using DigestiveEQ?<\/h3>","text_8TOCYfDXX5MtG83t":"<p>Horse owners who are using DigestiveEQ often report seeing improved changes in as early as 4 weeks, with horses appearing calmer and more settled.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Another noticeable improvement is in the consistency of manure. Some horses that have been scouring for months have reportedly formed solid manure within days of using our digestive gut supplement.<\/p><p><\/p><p>In 2 months, horse owners are beginning to see improved top line and condition, particularly noticing filling out above the flanks around the loin area.<\/p><p><\/p><p>After 3-4 months people are consistently noticing significant behavioural, performance, immune system and condition improvements, as well as a noted improved suppleness under saddle and putting on weight.<\/p><p><\/p><p>If you don’t see a result that quickly, don’t panic. Every horse is different with some taking longer to respond due to repopulation of healthy microbes, particularly in their hindgut. If your horse doesn’t have obvious outward symptoms of gastrointestinal upset, positive changes are going to be less obvious but can be as subtle as improved hoof growth and increased immunity. But remember, seeing the results is just the start. Supporting optimal digestion and the health of your horse’s gastrointestinal tract longer term with the correct diet in combination with Digestive HP will ensure optimal health and performance into the future.<\/p>","text_OZ5G9aGm9O2nw5vG":"<h3>What Evidence Do You Have That DigestiveEQ Is Effective?<\/h3>","text_9azVQ7nAFGkKtrL5":"<p>As part of the research and design phase of our digestive gut health supplement, we initially conducted trials with an early formulation. This formulation was tested on a variety of horses across different disciplines, yielding consistent reports of improvements in condition, topline, behaviour, manure consistency, performance, appearance, and stress resilience. Since then, the formulation has only improved, further enhancing these benefits.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Additionally, a separate field study was conducted by Professor Andrew Dart (BVSc PhD, Dip ACVS, Dip ECVS) from the University of Sydney, with a cohort of randomly selected horses. The results showed a remarkable increase in feed conversion, with some horses experiencing up to ninefold increases in weekly weight gain. Prof. Dart commented, \"It is difficult to dismiss the relationship between weight gain and the addition of this supplement.\"<\/p><p><\/p><p>Ingredient selection is at the heart of what we do. In <strong>DigestiveEQ,<\/strong> we only use ingredients that have been extensively researched, meeting the highest standards of scientific evaluation. Each ingredient is carefully chosen based on its proven functionality, with inclusion rates aligned with research to ensure their effectiveness in equine health. While we don’t conduct the original research on individual ingredients, we source only those that are backed by robust science and incorporate them into a formulation designed specifically for horses.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>DigestiveEQ i<\/strong>s now supported by thousands of testimonials from horse owners and receives strong support, recommendations, and endorsements from veterinarians.<\/p>","text_gGG5besrWrhWtOvq":"<h3>Is DigestiveEQ Safe For Laminitic Horses?<\/h3>","text_L4Pwa9iGxhpd9vNK":"<p>Yes it is. Like everything with laminitic horses, introduce it slowly, just to be on the safe side. Laminitic can be unpredictable, so slow is always best when adding something new to their diet.<\/p>","text_pcIKepbWwWIUjEhq":"<h3>Can DigestiveEQ Be Fed To Pregnant and Lactating Mares?<\/h3>","text_ZREYLLMuDdTguZH5":"<p>Yes, <strong>DigestiveEQ<\/strong> can be safely fed to pregnant and lactating mares to support their gut health and potentially also their milk production. It should be fine for foals to nibble on a bit of their mother's feed containing <strong>DigestiveEQ<\/strong>. However, as there aren't studies specifically aimed at foals for a majority of the ingredients, we can't recommend giving it as part of a foal's feed.<\/p>","text_psVEhD1CenjVGLkC":"<h3>Is It Safe To Use With Other Supplements?<\/h3>","text_osaXJTYTCvqFrbG4":"<p>As DigestiveEQ includes ingredients specifically designed to address gut health, it should be safe to feed alongside most other feeds and supplements. You may find that with the addition of DigestiveEQ and a balanced diet with vitamins and minerals, your horse may not need additional supplements. For example, DigestiveEQ contains a good amount of calcium, magnesium and a toxin binder, so if you are already feeding another supplement with those in it, you may find you can cut it out. No need to waste money on over-supplementing.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Please note that our supplements are not complete feeds and should be paired with a balanced diet and adequate amounts of forage.<\/p>","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0}}},"order":["breadcrumbs","main","instant_d_co_r9s_zz_gg_naabj8_TqUDEb","instant_ee130_oe_kb8_b_di_tcl_wKtmgz","instant_hh_kr_qqfi0ge_z6_r_ft_a7AeKh","instant_33_n6i_eh_mfzl7_udw8_WbqCWB","instant_n7_yh3w_d2_eu_xb_ne_qq_J3jDHy","instant_b8_gtp_j4_urla_s_cxp_k_crQaqN","instant_6jksz_i_tdrl9_pqm5e_HDeVJj","175509061845630821","instant_x4e_ft_uw09sdwlww6_LPGrp8"]}
